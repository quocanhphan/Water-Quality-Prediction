# Water Quality Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the potability of water based on various chemical indicators using machine learning models. The goal is to assist in environmental monitoring and public health initiatives by analyzing water quality data to determine if water sources are potable.

## Models
This project uses several machine learning models to evaluate water potability:

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Gradient Boosting

- Neural Networks
